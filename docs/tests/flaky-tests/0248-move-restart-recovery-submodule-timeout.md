# Move restart recovery submodule re-link exceeds the aggregate deadline

- **ID:** 0248
- **Status:** open
- **Date observed:** 2026-10-16
- **Test:** `restart recovery re-links submodules of an adopted or abandoned copy`
- **Owning file:** `apps/backend/src/core/environment-move.test.ts`
- **Original command:** `mise run test` on
  `feat/gateway-terminal-fallback-backoff` (web gateway terminal fallback
  reconnect backoff; no backend code changed). Several other worktrees were
  running suites on the host at the same time.
- **Failure:** the default 5000 ms test timeout at 5039.39 ms. The test's own
  `git submodule --quiet foreach --recursive` call
  (`environment-move.test.ts:786`) was then killed with `SIGTERM` (`timedOut:
  false`), which Bun reported as an unhandled error between tests and a
  dangling process it killed.
- **Suite counts:** backend 8,085 passed, 40 skipped, 3 failed across 438 files
  (324.01 s). The other two failures were the 0211 recurrence and
  `agent provider module boundaries`, which is deterministic on `main` at
  `9906db30` (`http-bridge-provider.ts` has 1,505 lines) and not a flake.
  Web, protocol, desktop, CLI, toolchain, root, bridge and lockfile groups
  passed.
- **Isolated rerun:** `mise run test:logged -- --name backend-env-move-file --
  bun test --cwd apps/backend --preload ../../tests/setup-node.ts
  ./src/core/environment-move.test.ts --parallel=1 --only-failures` passed the
  unchanged owning file in 18.9 s.
- **Evidence:** `/tmp/orkestrator-test-run.3Pp4em/workspace-web-backend-desktop-web-public-cli-protocol-toolchain.log.gz`.
- **Hypothesis:** the submodule fixture's Git subprocesses were slowed by
  concurrent host load; not established.
- **Changes:** recorded evidence only; no test, timeout, assertion or skip changed.

## Recurrence on 2026-10-16 during the storage writer guards merge

`mise run test:logged -- --name merge-tests -- mise run test` ran the backend
with two isolated workers within a four-slot workspace group while other
worktree validations shared the host. Two tests in the owning file exceeded
the five-second deadline: `move_environment > moves a worktree with nested
submodules (same disk)` (5,081.81 ms, line 350) and `restart recovery re-links
submodules of an adopted or abandoned copy` (5,733.49 ms, line 846). Their
pending submodule checks were then killed with `SIGTERM` and reported as
unhandled errors between tests.

`mise run test:logged -- --name merge-environment-move-isolated -- bun test
--cwd apps/backend --preload ../../tests/setup-node.ts
./src/core/environment-move.test.ts --parallel=1 --only-failures` passed the
unchanged owning file in 39.2 seconds. Evidence and aggregate package counts
are retained in
`/tmp/orkestrator-test-run.Q27xqQ/workspace-web-backend-desktop-web-public-cli-protocol-toolchain.log.gz`.
The shared-load hypothesis remains unconfirmed; no assertion, timeout or skip
was changed.

Aggregate backend counts for this observation: 8,341 passed, 40 skipped,
5 failed and 3 between-tests errors across 8,386 tests in 445 files
(391.37 seconds). The other failures are recorded in 0162, 0165 and 0248.
